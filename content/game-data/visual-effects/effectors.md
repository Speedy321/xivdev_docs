# Effectors

Effectors apply miscellaneous effects to emitters, particles, or the camera. In order to be used, they must either be triggered through a [timeline item](https://github.com/0ceal0t/Dalamud-VFXEditor/blob/3a9a91aaa9a867734b15474d2bbb55e0b2b3822b/AVFXLib/Models/Timeline/AVFXTimelineSubItem.cs#L17), or an [emitter](https://github.com/0ceal0t/Dalamud-VFXEditor/blob/8bea58ccf97df403f8b22cbe1b10ae2077006249/AVFXLib/Models/Emitter/AVFXEmitter.cs#L20).

There are several types of effectors:

* Point light
* Directional light
* Radial Blur
* Black hole
* Camera quake \(if you've ever been annoyed by the screen shake from Holy, this is why\)
