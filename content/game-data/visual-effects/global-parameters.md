# Global Parameters

These are global settings applied to the entire VFX. Parameters such as `Revised Scale` and `Revised Color` can be used to adjust the size and color of an entire VFX without having to manually change the values of each individual component.

Also of note are the `DrawLayer` parameter, which controls when the VFX is drawn \(such as `BeforeSky` or `BeforeCloud`\), and the `Clipbox` settings.
