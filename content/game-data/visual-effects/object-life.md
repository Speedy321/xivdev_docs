# Object Life

`Life` controls how long a particle lives, and can be somewhat counter-intuitive. `Life = -1` means that the emitter lives forever, so it's animations will only trigger once. If you want an emitter to continuously loop \(that is, die and get re-created\), set it a value greater than `-1`.
