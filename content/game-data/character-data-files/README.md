# Character Data Files

Character data is stored in each folder inside the `My Games/FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Real Reborn` folder. Each character folder is named similarly to `FFXIV_CHR0040000001000001`, where the portion following the `FFXIV_CHR` is the character's content ID.

## [Chat Log](chat-log.md)

The game writes your chat history to disk each time its internal buffer overflows, which potentially allows you to retrieve chat history in longer play sessions.
